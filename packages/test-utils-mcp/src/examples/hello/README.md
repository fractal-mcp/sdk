# Hello MCP Server Example

This example server exposes a single `sayHello` tool so tests can confirm that Model Context Protocol clients establish a session and invoke tools over Server-Sent Events and streamable HTTP transports. It does **not** exercise session state or storage; it is only intended to validate basic transport connectivity.
